ABOUT FOUNDER: In my time as a population health manager in Camden, I witnessed firsthand how the simplest of mistakes or wrong choices could spiral into homelessness and life-altering tragedies for individuals. I saw people I knew by name—real faces, real stories—struggling with homelessness and isolation. It became clear that their needs weren’t just physical; they needed hope, support, and a chance to rebuild.

NOTE COMPLETE -> I am committed to turning that belief into creating solutions that restore hope a

   Born from Experience, Driven by Purpose
   Our Origins
   In the heart of our communities, we have seen how quickly life can unravel—how a single misstep, an unexpected hardship, or an unforgiving system can push individuals into homelessness, isolation, or despair. Too often, those struggling with addiction, reentry, or mental health challenges find themselves without a place to turn, without the support they need to rebuild.
   <br/>
   <b>RIGHT Housing was born from this reality—not just as a shelter, but as a foundation for renewal</>b. We believe that a home is more than just four walls; it is a space where healing begins, where dignity is restored, and where hope is rekindled. Our mission is simple yet profound: to provide stability, support, and a second chance to those seeking to rise above their circumstances.
   <br/>
   Every person deserves an opportunity to reclaim their future. At RIGHT Housing, we are committed to walking alongside them—one step, one story, and one transformed life at a time.

Prompt for Creating a Full-Page Interactive Program & Services Section

Objective:
Design a visually stunning and interactive section for showcasing programs and services, where the titles are displayed on the left and their details on the right. Selecting a title will trigger a sliding animation to reveal or hide the corresponding details. This section should take up the full page and feature advanced but minimal animated SVG backgrounds to enhance aesthetics.

Requirements:

Layout:

Left Section: A vertical list of program and service titles, aligned neatly with spacing and hover effects. Titles should have an active state that indicates the currently selected item.
Right Section: The details of the selected program should appear in this section with smooth animations. Include a fade-in/out effect for text.

Animations:

The details section should slide up or down, depending on whether the program is expanding or collapsing, with a smooth and elegant transition (e.g., cubic-bezier easing).
Add micro-interactions like subtle scaling or color changes on hover for the titles and buttons.

SVG Background:

Use advanced, animated SVG elements as the background for the section. Examples include:
Floating geometric shapes that subtly move or rotate.
Gradient wave patterns that shift colors or flow slowly.
Particle effects or abstract lines that follow a coordinated movement.

Styling:

Minimalistic yet elegant design, with clean typography, ample white space, and complementary color schemes.
Use a modern font for headings and content, ensuring readability.
Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes.

Functionality:

Clicking on a program title should trigger the details to slide in/out dynamically, without overlapping other content.
The animations should be optimized for performance to ensure smooth transitions, even on lower-end devices.
Include a fallback or static version for browsers that do not support advanced animations.

User Experience:

Ensure that interactions feel intuitive and fluid.
Add accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and ARIA roles, for better usability.
Deliverables:
A fully functional, responsive, and visually striking section showcasing the programs and services, including all the animations and SVG background designs. Ensure the code is modular and reusable for future updates.
