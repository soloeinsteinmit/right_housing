Prompt for Creating a Full-Page Interactive Program & Services Section

Objective:
Design a visually stunning and interactive section for showcasing programs and services, where the titles are displayed on the left and their details on the right. Selecting a title will trigger a sliding animation to reveal or hide the corresponding details. This section should take up the full page and feature advanced but minimal animated SVG backgrounds to enhance aesthetics.

Requirements:

Layout:

Left Section: A vertical list of program and service titles, aligned neatly with spacing and hover effects. Titles should have an active state that indicates the currently selected item.
Right Section: The details of the selected program should appear in this section with smooth animations. Include a fade-in/out effect for text.

Animations:

The details section should slide up or down, depending on whether the program is expanding or collapsing, with a smooth and elegant transition (e.g., cubic-bezier easing).
Add micro-interactions like subtle scaling or color changes on hover for the titles and buttons.

SVG Background:

Use advanced, animated SVG elements as the background for the section. Examples include:
Floating geometric shapes that subtly move or rotate.
Gradient wave patterns that shift colors or flow slowly.
Particle effects or abstract lines that follow a coordinated movement.

Styling:

Minimalistic yet elegant design, with clean typography, ample white space, and complementary color schemes.
Use a modern font for headings and content, ensuring readability.
Maintain responsive design for all screen sizes.

Functionality:

Clicking on a program title should trigger the details to slide in/out dynamically, without overlapping other content.
The animations should be optimized for performance to ensure smooth transitions, even on lower-end devices.
Include a fallback or static version for browsers that do not support advanced animations.

User Experience:

Ensure that interactions feel intuitive and fluid.
Add accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and ARIA roles, for better usability.
Deliverables:
A fully functional, responsive, and visually striking section showcasing the programs and services, including all the animations and SVG background designs. Ensure the code is modular and reusable for future updates.
