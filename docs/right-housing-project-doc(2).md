# Right Housing NGO Website Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Core Idea
The project focuses on an NGO in the U.S. called "Right Housing," which aims to provide housing for individuals who have been recently released from prison, those rejected by their families, and individuals recovering from drug addiction who have been institutionalized. With the support of the U.S. government, Right Housing provides stable accommodations and support to help these individuals reintegrate into society. Additionally, they plan to extend their efforts to Ghana, focusing on transforming children's wards in hospitals into supportive and pleasant environments for young patients. This is the core idea behind the project.

### 1.2 Project Description
A modern, React-based website for Right Housing NGO that showcases their dual mission:
- U.S. Initiative: Providing housing and support for formerly incarcerated individuals, family-displaced persons, and recovering addiction patients
- Ghana Initiative: Transforming children's hospital wards into supportive, healing environments

### 1.3 Project Objectives

- Facilitate online donations through Stripe integration
- Enable program applications and support requests
