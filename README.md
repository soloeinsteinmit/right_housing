# Right Housing

Right Housing is a U.S based NGO which aims to provide housing for individuals who have been recently released from prison, those rejected by their families, and individuals recovering from drug addiction who have been institutionalized. With the support of the U.S. government, Right Housing provides stable accommodations and support to help these individuals reintegrate into society. Additionally, they plan to extend their efforts to Ghana, focusing on transforming children's wards in hospitals into supportive and pleasant environments for young patients
